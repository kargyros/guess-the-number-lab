// getGuess: function(){

//--------------------TASKS----------------------
// 1. Add a prevGuesses property to the game object initialized to an empty array.

// 2. Add a getGuess method to game that prompts the player to enter a guess with a message formatted as: Enter a guess between [smallestNum] and [biggestNum]. 

//. ENsure that the getGuess method returns a value:
//  is a number not a string.
//  is between smallestNum and biggestNum, inclusive.

// 4. From within the play method, invoke the getGuess method from inside a loop, and add the new guess to the prevGuesses array


// -----------------FEATURES--------------------
// Allow the player to continually be prompted to enter their guess at the secret number until they guess correctly.

// If the player has an incorrect guess, display an alert message that informs the player:

// - Whether their guess is too high or too low, andâ€¦

// - A list of all the previously guessed numbers (without showing the square brackets of an array). 

// - If the player has guessed the secret number:

// - Display an alert message that congrats the player and informs them of how many guesses they took.

// - End the gameplay.
